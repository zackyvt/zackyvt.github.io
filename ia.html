<p><code>Line of inquiry: How and to what effect does the symbolism displayed in these artworks portray the struggle for children in today’s society?</code></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The phrase <em>“a picture is worth a thousands words”</em> was coined all the way back in 1913, yet its no less true today. In the grand scheme of political activism, its indisputable that <strong>stunts</strong> and art are what captures the attention of people – not a monotonous bureaucratic address. This inevitability gives power to bold charismatic figures who know how to appeal to the masses, who cram their own personal narrative to their dissidents with the weapon of explicit artistic propaganda. History has cycled through these kinds of figures and tales repeatedly: Hitler and his Reich; Stalin and his KGB. What would not be expected is an unknown  street artist from an affluent UK urban city influencing the world through anti-establishment structuralist graffiti murals – <strong>Banksy</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike the classic political art, Banksy uses highly implicit symbolism as a way to critique the establishment at large. This symbolism goes to the extent of his intentions being unclear at times.  Yet that is the very glamor of his art… the audience finds the critique themselves through careful analysis and appreciation of the work at hand; the message isn’t shoved into the audience’s mind as with propaganda. A provocative insight into society is critiquing the way it treats the most indisputably vulnerable and innocent members. Hence, this essay will explore a critique of society’s mistreatment of children through the lenses of Banksy’s artistic symbolism.</p>
<h2 id="textual-analysis">Textual Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="hula-hooping-girl">1. Hula Hooping Girl</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/10/19/2020_10_19_106068_1603088624._large.jpg" alt="hula hooping girl" title="Hula Hooping Girl" width="500"></p>
<p>A distinct characteristic of childhood is the ability to view the world in rose-tinted-spectacles; no matter how tenacious things get, all a child can phantom is play time. This perception can be interpreted quite evidently from the mural. Beside the broken bicycle, the girl makes the best out of the situation, using the tires as a hula-hoop. This is a reasonable face-value interpretation of the work. However, works of Banksy often are much deeper than what they seem at face value, typically being in the critique of grand societal ideas.</p>
<p>An alternate theory is that perhaps the bicycle wasn’t initially broken but was instead broken by the girl so she could use the tire as a hula-hoop. The girl broke an already functional object so she could use the tire as a toy and entertain herself. This scenario has a slew of interesting implications when generalized into societal ideas.</p>
<p>If we consider the bicycle as this already functioning societal system, perhaps representing the education system children are forced to go through. Then this girl is metaphorically “breaking” this already functioning education system to do what she wants to do. Perhaps this “breaking” represents the act of dropping out of school or deciding not to pursue the traditional path of going to university and getting a stable job. The symbology of hula-hooping the tire may represent the act of doing what makes her happy; pursuing her own dreams which are astray from the traditional path society upholds.</p>
<p>This mural is an exposition into Banksy’s anti establishment character, in this case the way the system crushes the happiness of children. This interpretation can be generalized even further though, where the child is in it of itself a symbolic metaphor. Instead of the girl representing children, perhaps the girl represents the <em>inner-child</em> present in all of us. All people possess an inner-child full of hopes &amp; dreams which may go against the system (the bicycle) at large. Yet instead of seeking this inner fantasy, people choose to suppress it. This suppression illustrates the cause as to why the girl in the mural is painted completely black and white - not exactly a typical depiction of a child considering children are thought of to be full of joy and color. The bicycle in the mural would then signify something much larger than just the education system, perhaps representing the establishment at large; the capitalist market, the government, societal expectations, and so on.</p>
<p>The core message of the mural is that there is a small inner-child in all of us who wants to pursue our true dreams and truly be happy, yet we suppress this because of societal expectation. This mural may even be self-referential to Banksy himself. He is the epitome to the idea of having an inner identity who goes against society (by doing illegal graffiti art critiquing the establishment), while his real identity is still part of society.</p>
<h3 id="bridge-farm-murral">2. Bridge Farm Murral</h3>
<p><img src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a6d961b7749029f6fc413f7b0196f018?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=1594&amp;cropW=2837&amp;xPos=137&amp;yPos=154&amp;width=862&amp;height=485" alt="bridge farm murral" title="Bridge Farm Murral" width="500"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, its discernible that there seems to be two highly conflicting artistic styles in this work. The primitive black &amp; white stick-man style drawings contrasted with the colored pseudo-realistic image of the burning tire. The burning tire is considerably inappropriately placed, as its so divergent from all the other elements of the mural. Disregarding the tire completely, the mural would just seem like a child’s elementary drawing, yet with the tire it changes the work completely. The burning tire symbolically distracts or even ruins the highly simplistic childlike nature of the rest of the work. This is the first indication that the tire is likely a metaphorical symbol in this mural, it represents much more than just a tire, connecting the artwork to a more significant sociopolitical message.</p>
<p>The tire represents this striking object which overshadows everything else, including the child. This depiction of an alluring overwhelming <em>thing</em> exemplifies the idea of a materialistic commodity in a consumerist society. The child, the house and the flower on the other hand are all conveyed as dull. The metaphor present is the prioritization of material commodities (the captivating tire) over real concerns such as children, social housing (signified by the small house in the mural) and nature (signified by the flower). In fact the phrase “to burn the tire” means to drive very fast in a car, and a car is a distinct symbol of consumerism. Every element of the mural is a symbol in the metaphor.</p>
<p>To give context, this mural was painted at Bristol school, in the very same city which Banksy started out in. The city of Bristol has steep income inequality with over 70,000 people living in income deprivation and 21% of children living in low-income families [4]. This work is in critique of this social issue. A critique of how the people of Bristol are more concerned about their own material wealth, buying themselves new fancy cars, and polluting the children from its toxic smug (illustrated by the smoking tire in the mural) rather than the well-being of children, or their housing or the natural environment that they live in.</p>
<p>Aside from the illustrative symbology, taking the mural at its narrative value yields the same apprehension. The child is playing a game of hoop rolling, except the hoop is reciprocated with a burning tire. The transformation from hoop to tire exemplifies the idea of progress, key to the industrial revolution (which also happens to be the peak popularity of the game). The objective of hoop rolling is to keep the hoop upright for as long as possible. Naturally, a burning tire would not stay upright for a very long time. This represents how industrial society is unsustainable and it will ultimately be up to children (a symbol for the future genereation) to one day sustain this mess for as long as they can.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the mural came with a note from Banksy himself. In the note, written <em>“remember it’s always easier to get forgiveness than permission”</em>. This phrase is conceivably a sarcastic mockery of the constant repetitive cycle of <em>all talk but no action</em> that comes from the establishment. Politicians and other figures will always be head strong into apologizing for the things they did, yet they will take zero action in preventing said thing from happening again. At the end of the day, these words will be meaningless, and the only hope is whether or not our leaders of tommorow will be able to keep the metaphorical hoop upright.</p>
<h3 id="crayon-boy">3. Crayon Boy</h3>
<p><img src="https://banksyexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CRAYON-BOY-2.jpg" alt="Crayon Boy" title="Crayon Boy" width="500"></p>
<p>Just like the previous work, there is an immediate contrast that pops out at the viewer. A disparity between the dull black and white image of a boy holding a machine gun and the child-like colorful surrounding background. It diverges between two highly opposing ideas: the dull serious <em>real</em> nature of war on top of the light bright happy youthful life of a child. The work itself expresses a juxtaposition of the innocence a child should go through and the harsh reality where some children are forced to go to war and engage in violence - tarnishing them of their childhood.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous works, this mural is quite direct with its meaning. The elements of the mural are quite explicit, the gun obviously denotes war and the crayon drawings obviously denotes childhood in some way. And the contrast between the two symbols is expressed in an easily deconstructed way. The explicitness may itself be a symbol. The two precious works discussed had quite a vague and controversial message, opposition to the education system or industrial progress is subjective, yet the opposition of child soldiers is universally true (some may even consider an objective moral stance). The intensity of the subject at hand (child soldiers) is perhaps conveyed by Banksy with a boldness and indirectness which doesn’t come very often with this works.</p>
<p>Going back to the mural at hand, there are a few displays which bring quite a significance. One major element is the bullets in the machine gun are signified as crayons, the very same crayons that appear to draw the colorful childlike background of the mural. In fact, the only link between the dull child soldier and the colorful happy background are the crayon bullets. Furthermore, there is a no parking sign that seems quite out of place. Its not as colorful and childlike as the background, yet not as dull as the child soldier. These two appalling elements likely means they are symbols in some way.</p>
<p>The firing of bullets is the ultimate purpose of a gun, in fact, it is the ultimate purpose of war in general. The firing of a gun is what shapes the environment of war. Thus the replacement of bullets with crayons juxtaposes two opposing “purposes” and “environments”. With the bullets, the ultimate purpose is to cause harm and violence. With crayons, the ultimate purpose is joy and fun. This is a powerful juxtaposition as it posits that the child should be firing joy and childlike fun, not violence.</p>
<p>Lastly, the “No Parking” sign is actually a real world object, not a drawing by Banksy. The “No Parking” sign expresses the idea of wrongdoing, and illegality. In this case, this sign is placed on the mural as a way to signify how child soldiers are a wrongdoing, and they are illegal, yet despite that they are still such commonplace in many parts of the world. This is perhaps the cherry on top critique by Banksy. People will constantly promise to stop the mistreatment of children, yet just like illegal parking, it will keep happening no matter what…</p>
<h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2>
<h3 id="banksys-postmodernist-ideals">Banksy’s Postmodernist Ideals</h3>
<p>At the heart of Banksy’s every creation is a rejection of the establishment. Be it a rejection of the government, the economic ruins, or simply a rejection of societal standards &amp; conventionalities. A commonplace <em>grand narrative</em> is established as the status quo, and Banksy aims to deconstruct it using his artistic symbolism. This refusal of the <em>grand narrative</em> is not exclusive to Banksy. A philosophical stance known as postmodernism posits that the world has essentially been reduced to a social hive-mind unable to think independently outside of the artificial constraints set by the elite. A grand narrative persists which goes practically unquestioned by people. From the 3 texts explored above, Banksy rejects the grand narrative of: the education system, the Vietnam war and insdustrial progress. Indirectly, Banksy asserts that the struggles of children today are always in some way rooted with the grand narrative of the establishment.</p>
<h3 id="exemplification-of-structuralism">Exemplification of Structuralism</h3>
<p>The idea of symbolism goes hand in hand with structuralism. Symbolism according to the the Oxford dictionary is the <em>“the use of symbols to represent ideas or qualities.”</em> [5]. Note that those ideas need not have a connection to society &amp; pop culture at large, that is where structuralism comes into play. The notion that art need be interpreted through the realm of human culture and with context of its environment is a belief that comes with structuralism. The murals shown above are structuralist in nature as they are interpreted with the lens of the societal issues it concerns. These two tools: structuralism and symbolism; bridges the connection between a flat grafitti painting of a child and the complex sociopolitical ideas which surround children and their struggle in today’s time.</p>
<h3 id="dadaism">Dadaism</h3>
<p>For someone who has only been exposed to the classical <em>fine art</em> which has existed for most of history, Banky’s art appears to be almost absurd at times. The use of opposing artistic styles (such as the ones found in Crayon Boy and the Bridge Farm Murral), the breaking of the 4th wall (found in the Hula Hoop Girl), as well as the general degeneracy of this type of grafitti art. His art almost does not seem like arrt at all, being more alike a meme at time. Despite this, his art has such a striking societal message, one appealing and so different is more poignant than the standard <em>high art</em> we are used to seeing. <strong>Dadaism</strong>: an art movement which began in opposition of the second world war which fundamentalized the role of art, and rejected the classic borgouisie establishment art - Banksy is apart of this movement. Perhaps the reason Banksy’s portayal of child struggle is so compelling is due to these Dadaistic ideas; <em>the art itself is absurd enough to cause a glance, but the message is powerful enough to warm a heart</em>.</p>
<h3 id="capitalist-realism">Capitalist Realism</h3>
<p>An amusing irony surfaces when discussing artists like Banksy. Despite being famous for being in critique of the system and being opposed to the shallow consumerist nature of capitalism, he has essentially been commodified in the very same system he opposes. Works of Banksy which critique capitalism, end up being bought for millions by the same capitalists the work unanimously opposes. This leads to an interesting anomaly where whatever work or message Banksy produces, it will always be reduced to a commodity. This idea is termed <em>capitalist realism</em>. A consequence of capitalist realism is that Banksy’s influential murals as highlighted above, will do little to none in actually combating the struggle of children.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, the transformation of an idea as intricate as the struggle of children into the form of art will always be exactly that… <em>a transformation</em>. To view artistic symbolism as something magical would be inherently dishonest. At the end of the day, art is a tool - a brilliantly executed tool which can grasp our cognition in such a way that words may not. Our minds evolved as something which primarily supported vision, not rational critical analysis. Thus the deconstruction of such complex ideas into a visual medium often gives us a keen insight into the issue in a way that could not have been possible otherwise. Banksy’s ambition has always been to provide this insight.</p>
<p>Through the course of these 3 artworks, the development of a new intuition for the struggle of children in society emerges; by looking at various complex thoughts not as high-level critical abstractions but instead as a physical drawing on a mural. Acumen for the way the grand narrative has ruined the creativity &amp; dreams of children, and perhaps the inner child in all of us. Questioning the very fabric of whether technological &amp; industrial progress should be above the well-being of the world’s children. And ultimately, a deep realization that children will continue to struggle; continue to die in war; continue to go hungry; unless there is a halt in the continual reliance on the same system of all-talk and no action.</p>
